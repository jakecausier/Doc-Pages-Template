<p>Adding new products is very similar to adding pages.</p>

<h3>Add a product</h3>

<p>Click the menu item <span class="menu-item">Products</span> and then the
<span class="menu-item">Products</span> submenu. An empty table will show, with
the <span class="button button-plain">New Product</span> button in the top right.
Click that to open a modal, where you can type in the name of your product in the
<span class="input-field">Product Name</span> field.</p>
